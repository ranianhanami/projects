This is the final group project of the Image Processing course. 
My job: 
- I coordinated to analyze the difference between conventional and deep learning methods in dehazing O-HAZE dataset images.
- Developed a deep learning model for dehazing images using TensorFlow and gained SSIM around 0.75.
- Contributed to analyzing the differences between conventional and deep learning methods.
